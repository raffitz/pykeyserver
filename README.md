# Pykeyserver

An HKP server built on python.

Not meant for use in production!
Do not use this in production!

This was developed in a classroom environment for a classroom environment: to share temporary keys generated by students amongst themselves, without contaminating or interfering with notable public keyservers.

Due to hardware restrictions, notable alternatives such as [Hockeypuck](https://github.com/hockeypuck/hockeypuck) or [Hagrid](https://gitlab.com/hagrid-keyserver/hagrid) were not suitable.

[SKS](https://github.com/SKS-Keyserver/sks-keyserver)'s lack of post-systemd documentation (every single configuration document I read mentioned initscripts) made it unsuitable as well.
